Instructions:

● Use the provided sample tables and data to write SQL queries for each question.

● Write your queries in the workbench, make it work and share the results as screenshots in docs/text/pdf format on the V-learn.

● If a question requires multiple queries, number them accordingly (e.g., Query 1, Query 2, etc.).

● For each question, focus on using nested queries and joins appropriately.

● Provide the final query result for each question.
